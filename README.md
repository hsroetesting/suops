Suops - YouTube Subscription Grouping Utility

I don't really want to work on this a lot anymore but I do know other people might and I'm finding out other people have actually made their own extensions doing the same functions as mine. So here is my last stand for this project - open sourcing.

I tried my best with the documentation in the files. If there's anything needing explaning just ask and I'll try to answer.
